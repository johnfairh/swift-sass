Set up to provide a wrapper service that integrates with shutdown.

1) Xcode build doesn't work because of a swift-async-algorithms bug
   to do with its usage of SwiftCollections that is fixed but not
   released

2) Test seems to work on CLI, need to step through visually and
   confirm it's doing the right things

3) Docs / Docs-integration and usage description pending
