/// Methods required to implement a stylesheet importer.
///
/// Importers resolve `@import`, `@use`, and `@forward` rules in
/// stylesheets.  The methods are called back by the compiler during compilation.  You
/// don't need this to include the contents of a filesystem directory: see instead
/// `ImportResolver.loadPath(_:)`.
///
/// You could use this to present network resources or dynamically constructed content.
///
/// An import has two steps: canonicalization and loading.
///
/// `Importer.canonicalize(...)` is always called first with whatever URL
/// text the user has written in their rule.  The routine interprets that and returns a _canonical_
/// URL that is absolute with a scheme.
///
/// The compiler most likely implements a cache based on canonical URLs.  If the compiler
/// does not have a stylesheet cached for the canonical URL then it calls
/// `Importer.load(...)` with that URL to get at the content.
///
/// ### File extension rules
///
/// Sass itself handles imports from the filesystem using various filename conventions.
/// Users of your importer mostly likely expect the same behavior if the URLs you
/// are importing resemble filenames with extensions and directories.
///
/// From the Sass embedded protocol documentation:
///
/// The importer should look for stylesheets by adding the prefix `_` to the
/// URL's basename, and by adding the extensions `.sass` and `.scss` if the
/// URL doesn't already have one of those extensions. For example, given the URL
/// "foo/bar/baz" the importer should look for:
///
/// 1. `foo/bar/baz.sass`
/// 2. `foo/bar/baz.scss`
/// 3. `foo/bar/_baz.sass`
/// 4. `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
///
/// Given the URL "foo/bar/baz.scss" the importer should look for:
///
/// 1. `foo/bar/baz.scss`
/// 2. `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
///
/// If the importer finds a stylesheet at more than one of these URLs then it
/// must throw an error indicating that the import is ambiguous.
///
/// If none of the possible paths are valid then the importer should perform the
/// same resolution on the URL followed by `/index`. In the example above, it
/// should additionally look for:
///
/// 1. `foo/bar/baz/_index.sass`
/// 2. `foo/bar/baz/index.sass`
/// 3. `foo/bar/baz/_index.scss`
/// 4. `foo/bar/baz/index.scss`
///
/// If more than one of these implicit index resources exist then the importer must
/// throw an error indicating that the import is ambiguous.
public protocol Importer {
    /// Convert an imported URL to its canonical format.
    ///
    /// The returned URL must be absolute and include a scheme.  If the routine
    /// happens to be called with a resource's canonical URL (including something
    /// the routine previously returned) then it must be returned unchanged.
    ///
    /// - parameter eventLoop: The current event loop.
    /// - parameter ruleURL: The text following `@import` or `@use` in
    ///   a stylesheet.

    ///   See [import-only files](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import#import-only-files).
    /// - returns: The canonical absolute URL, or `nil` if the importer doesn't recognize the
    ///   import request to have the compiler try the next importer.
    /// - throws: Only when `importURL` cannot be canonicalized: it is definitely
    ///   this importer's responsibility to do so, but it can't.  For example, if the request is
    ///   "foo" but both `foo.sass` and `foo.css` are available.  If "foo" didn't match
    ///   anything then the importer should return `nil` instead.
